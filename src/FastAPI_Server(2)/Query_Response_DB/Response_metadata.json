    "response": "Here's a combined explanation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and inheritance concept in Java:\n\nIn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), objects are created to represent real-world things or concepts, having their own data (fields/attributes) and actions (methods/procedures). This programming approach organizes code into self-contained units - objects - that work together to solve problems. When building a program using OOP, you create objects that interact with each other. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows one object class to inherit the properties and behavior of another object class. In Java, inheritance is achieved through the use of a subclass (or derived class) that inherits the variables and methods of a superclass (or base class). The subclass can then add new fields and methods or override the ones inherited from the superclass. This relationship between classes enables code reuse, facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships among objects, and promotes modularity and maintainability in software design.\n\n**Source:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)",
